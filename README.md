4.6 Use of newsletter software
If you would like to receive our newsletter, we need an e-mail address and additional information that will allow us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and agree to receive the newsletter.
 
We use the so-called double opt-in procedure to ensure that newsletters are sent in a consistent manner. This way the potential recipient can be included in a distribution list.

5. Legal basis for processing personal data
Our legal basis for collecting and using personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have your consent to do so.
 
If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party) other than as described in this privacy policy, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
 
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data or wish to submit a Data Access Request, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “12. Contact” heading.
 
6. With whom might we share your personal data
We may transfer or disclose your personal data to the following categories of recipients:
to our group companies, third party services providers, suppliers, agents, and other organisations who provide data processing services to us, or who otherwise process personal data on our behalf for purposes that are described in this privacy policy or notified to you when we collect your personal data (such as advertising, analytics, customer support);
to any government department, agency, court or other official and/or regulatory bodies where we believe disclosure is necessary as a matter of applicable law or regulation (such as in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, or other legal process), to exercise, establish, participate in, or defend our legal rights, or limit the damages we sustain in litigation or other legal dispute, or to protect your vital interests, privacy, or safety, or those of our customers or any other person;
to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.
Except as set out above, we will not disclose your personal data save where we need to do so in order to enforce this privacy policy, our rights generally, or where required or permitted by applicable local or foreign law.
Whenever we share personal data, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. This may include without limitation aggregating or de-identifying information so that it is not intended to be used by the third party to identify you.
 
7. Data retention
We retain personal data we collect from you for as long as necessary for the purposes for which the personal data was collected or where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so, or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or regulatory requirements. Even if you close your account, we will retain certain information in order to meet our obligations.
 
When we have no ongoing legitimate need to process your personal data, we will either securely destroy, erase, delete or anonymise it, or if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
 
8. Your data protection rights
You have the following data protection rights:
If you wish to access, correct, or update your personal data, you can exercise these rights at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “12. Contact” heading.
You can object to processing of your personal data, ask us to restrict processing of your personal data, ask us to delete your personal data, or request portability of your personal data. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “12. Contact” heading.
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can usually exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you. Alternatively, or to opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided under the “12. Contact” heading.
If we have collected and process your personal data with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “12. Contact” heading. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal data. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
 
9. Security
Whilst all reasonable efforts will be taken to protect your personal data, no data storage or transmission can be guaranteed as 100% secure. We endeavour to protect all personal data using reasonable and appropriate physical, administrative, technical, and organisational measures, and in accordance with our internal security procedures and applicable law.
 
If you have been given or have created log-in details to provide you with access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping those details confidential in order to prevent unauthorised access to your accounts.
 
10. Privacy by Design
Royal Dispatch Logistics has adopted the principle of privacy by design and will ensure that the definition and planning of all new or significantly changed systems that collect or process personal data will be subject to due consideration of privacy issues, including the completion of one or more data protection impact assessments.
 
The data protection impact assessment will include:
Consideration of how personal data will be processed and for what purposes
Assessment of whether the proposed processing of personal data is both necessary and proportionate to the purpose(s)
Assessment of the risks to individuals in processing the personal data
What controls are necessary to address the identified risks and demonstrate compliance with legislation
Use of techniques such as data minimization and pseudonymisation will be considered where applicable and appropriate.
 
11. Breach Notification
It is Royal Dispatch Logistics’ policy to be fair and proportionate when considering the actions to be taken to inform affected parties regarding breaches of personal data. In line with applicable laws and regulations, where a breach is known to have occurred which is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the relevant supervisory authority will be informed within 72 hours.
 
12. Contact
We have appointed individuals who are responsible for the protection and security of your personal data. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, grievances, or complaints about this privacy policy or the manner in which we treat your personal data, or if you want to request any information about your personal data or believe that we are holding incorrect personal data on you, please contact our data protection team at osilitsolutions@gmail.com
 
If you wish to unsubscribe from marketing communications, please use the unsubscribe link on any email communication.
 
13. Notification of changes
We reserve the right to amend or vary this policy from time to time to reflect evolving legal, regulatory, or business practices. When we update our privacy policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make (which, for minor changes, may include posting the revised privacy policy to our Site with immediate effect).
